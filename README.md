The Osu-PPS Map Downloader Program is a powerful and (not)user-friendly application designed to facilitate the process of downloading and managing beatmaps from [osu-pps site](https://osu-pps.com).

## 🛠️ How to setup

To start, clone the git repository:

```shell
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/richardscull/osu-pps-maps-downloader
# git clone will take a while, just be patient
cd osu-pps-maps-downloader
```

After that, use `Start.bat` to build and run the program.

###### Note: Linux users can use `npm i` and `npm run buildAndRun` commands

## 🍺 Many thanks to grumd!

This repo is very dependent on his database of maps, so respect to him.

(I also used his beatmap interfaces 🫠)
